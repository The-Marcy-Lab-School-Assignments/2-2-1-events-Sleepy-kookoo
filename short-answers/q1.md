# Question
What is Event Driven Architecture?

# Answer
    Event Driven Architecture is a communication network for the computer system. It does not have to constantly check in with the other parts of the computer system because the each part will automatically send a message if it has done something and if it has done something other parts of the computer are interested in, it will join in.
